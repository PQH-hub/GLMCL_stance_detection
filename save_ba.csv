"The liberals' contributions to this section are basically saying that two Articles and four Amendments will fix what two Articles and three Amendments haven't. Yet, the states do a good job of running elections and the required IDs are easy to get, in a process already overseen by our heavily politicized DOJ. Regarding the extravagant demand for transportation, both major parties have local people who drive you to get IDs or to vote already. We should keep that effort in the private sector where it arose. If you are frantic enough not to trust the judicial system already, one more amendment won't cure what ails you. What would help all of us is more knowledge of history - which we won't find on the Soros blogs. Force people to vote? When all they are interested in is celebrity and sports buzz or their iPhones, absolutely not.

"This blurb fails to mention that man yyears ago, Professor Ehrlich made a highly publicized bet. With his Malthusian doom and gloom, he predicted resources would be scarcer and run out, or at least dwindle as the world population grew.

Making it easier to fire people reduces wages and in the short term may lead to higher growth by stimulating investment. But then in a decade or so the consumer base you use to have run out of savings, are loaded up with debt and are systematically replaced with a new generation of workers who are paid less, have fewer benefits and less disposable income. Demand start to slip, investment opportunities in the real economy dry up and the next thing you know you have Apple sitting on a mountain of cash because they have run out of consumers who can afford their products and they can make more money out of financial speculation than trying to create profitable products that are cheap enough for an impoverished proletariat. Continuously narrowing your consumer base and expecting long term stability is just plain dumb.

"I believe that the right to vote is sufficiently enumerated without having to go through the amendment process. Instead of another amendment, we need elected officials who take seriously their obligation to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies - including those who would disenfranchise millions of American citizens.

We need to rise up against efforts to disenfranchise college students through various technicalities in residency requirements as violations of the equal protection clause.

I find it ironic that our computers are now fast enough to handle High Def but the information content of recording has been decreasing and the bit rate of radio is now below standard streaming, even on Classical stations like WQXR. There is no substitute for being in a room with musicians and others who share the feeling, and the easier it is to get low quality music, the less we want music of any caliber.",musician,1,1.0

Until the most powerful president thus far in history FDR forced them to change course just so he could stop them blocking his efforts to fight the Great Depression?

This is incorrect, and could lead to fatalism that could harm people who are overweight. For example, I lost 70 pounds. That was at least a year ago. It has not come back. It is easy to keep off. The studies to which you refer examine calorie restriction diets, which do not work because they induce a starvation-like state that leads to metabolic changes. Changing the *types* of foods we eat is far more productive. There's evidence that eliminating wheat alone will reduce the number of calories people eat by an average of 300 a day.

In fact, without the benefit of negotiated job protections or statutory dismissal procedures, like those overturned in Vergara, teachers may be fired for any number of reasons that are discriminatory or capricious, and completely unrelated to job performance. Is a 39 year old, 15-year teacher costing too much on the salary schedule? Then give them the ax. The ADEA does not apply to employees under the age of 40, even if they are expressly terminated because of age. Did a teacher blow the whistle on an unsavory practice at school, related to their job? Well, under Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410 (2006), that teacher may not have any First Amendment protection for that speech. And gay, lesbian and transgender teachers have no federal protection from discrimination unless and until our Congress passes ENDA. Until then, such discrimination is perfectly legal in many states.

I like it the way it is now. Just like Social Security it was not meant for all. The system doesn't have the resources to expand it's coverage. The reason we have Medicare is to care of the elderly People pay into the system for the benefits the government will give them in the future. It won't be able to do that if the number of people getting benefits isn't fewer than the people who pay into the system. This is how some get more benefits than they put in. It's because some will get nothing. That is why it won't work if you make this benefit available to others.,medicare,1,1.0

For my generation NATO was mainly about defending Western Europe against the feared encroachment of the then Soviet Union. Following the second world war Germany was weak and divided. NATO's real mission ended with the reunification of Germany and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since those events NATO has been an organization in search of a purpose. It keeps getting dragged in to questionable areas like Afghanistan and middle eastern civil wars such as happened in Libya. The USA should move to withdraw its military and its money from Europe at the earliest opportunity. Where else to station troops? probably on our border with Mexico. I don;t suppose defending that border will be as costly as NATO has been. It should leave funds left over for fixing our many neglected internal problems,nato,0,0.0

Reading directly in another language without the filter of translation, engaging with another culture and another mode of seeing and thinking about the world, and learning how to express oneself in another tongue - all of these things have no meaning to the utilitarians and the philistines. I suppose if everyone else just spoke English we could dispense with all this nonsense about foreign languages. And by the way, it's not just French that's being extirpated at SUNY Albany - it's Italian, Russian, classics and theater, too. But that's ok, none of that has anything to do with conducting business.",humanity program,1,0.0
"After 35 years as a college professor, I see the introduction of firearms on to college campuses as a potential disaster. This is an environment in which young people, often for the first time in theri lives, are trying to navigate their way through the world at large. Examinations, personal relationships, and other factors create stresses, in some cases more than they can cope with.

"Few here seem to realize the one belief all Federal Judges share: The rule of law is first and foremost a tool to serve business. It's part of the reason the Justices often get on so well personally. The letter of the law did not radically change concerning same sex marriage, but the attitudes of the great majority of the citizenry did and doing business became more difficult for companies doing business in states that stubbornly held on to the last century's prejudices. So the Supreme Court had a eureka moment and ruled gay people had the same rights as the rest of the American People. Donald Trump has famously promised, if elected, to use the power of the Oval Office to drag his enemies through the courts. How is that arbitrary application of power to be seen as anything but a descent into corruption and an end to rule of law and the beginning of the rule of tyrants?

"Mr. Adams, in the absence of regulations, there would be no financial fallout. As an example, auto emissions impose large costs on society i.e., pollution, and on many individuals in society, for example those with respiratory problems. But car manufacturers do not bear those costs - the costs are externalities to the manufacturer. Markets are in general very good at coordinating supply and demand and allocating capital but markets only work if economic actors both receive the benefits but also bear the costs of their business decisions. Regulations, however imperfect, are necessary because, in many circumstances economic actors receive the profits but do not pay the costs of their activity. In such circumstances it is rational for a firm maximize its profits while ignoring the costs, however large, of its business activities. If there were no emissions regulations, including penalties for violating, those regulations, VW would face no financial fallout. They would build diesel cars that maximized their profit and that imposed tremendous costs on everyone else. There would be no incentive whatsoever for them to do anything else.",auto regulation,1,1.0

I despise Trump and view his election as a potential disaster. But Justices like serving members of the military should remain silent and not enter the political fray. Would those who support Ginsburg's public comments about Trump also support the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff coming out in favor of his election? I strongly doubt it. Indeed, they would probably demand his scalp and they would be right to do so.",ginsburg,0,0.0

Either than, or you just don't care and are willing to say anything to justify continuing down the same path you've been pursuing, which while it is not entirely to blame for what happened in Orlando (and elsewhere) UNQUESTIONABLY contributed to it. You're on the wrong side of history and the wrong side of the moral divide on this - indeed, you're on the wrong side of Christ's teachings, if you really care.",harmful atmosphere gay,0,0.0

"Perhaps rather than forcing greek societies - private organizations controlled individually by charters mandating single-sex admittance - to change their policies, perhaps universities could instead change rules that force fraternities to be the center of social life on campus. Allowing sororities to host parties, for instance, would put women in charge of the distribution of alcohol, which in turn could help to curtail instances of alcohol-related sexual assault. Campuses forcing greek life to go co-ed will lead only to the national chapters of these organizations to suspend their charters at the school. These organizations will, and in my experience have, continue to operate as an underground organization, rather than actually disband; this would only exacerbate the problem, as a secret frat or sorority can be controlled even less than one that operates in the light of day.",fraternity sorority,0,0.0
"There are two major points that bother me about the possibility of players legally doping themselves. The first one is that regardless of the control and vigilance exerted over the use of game enhancing drugs, there will always be secondary effects that will either affect the athlete in the sport or later, at home or over a longer period of time. I don't know if it is ever truly ethical to affect a person's long term health over a short period gain. The second problem I have with this doping issue is the unfair advantage it gives over other players. It is pretty clearly observed in the Olympics that very developed countries (USA, England, Germany, China, etc.) have funds to give a boost and every advantage possible to already talented athletes. It just seems to me that these drugs are something that would be more affordable and easier to monitor where money flows, creating an even bigger gap between economically advantaged players and those with less resources (even if they are physically on par to each other). Would games become even more a show of force between the haves and the have nots?",doping,0,0.0

Seriously? Gillers must be joking.

Judge Ginsberg has every right to voice her opinion regarding the fitness of Donald Trump for the highest office in the land.

Free tuition will only increase college enrollments if we prepare the students for college. The tuition free education is great but we have to start preparing the students early. This way they will strive for the free education. Low income families want the best for their children and this is a way to give the minority students the same chances as other students. I believe that the community colleges are great for students and the funding if made available will allow our students to complete a 2 year degree and more forward with the motivation to get that 4 year degree. We are trying this method with our children in 2016. The federal and state governments must invest in our institutions where the majority of our students are attending.,college,1,1.0

"I share these concerns but I believe that the problem lies in a misalignment of the 9 justices with the body politic, and that this is the result of 30- and 40-year tenures of modern justices. The solution is term limits for justices. Every president should nominate 1 justice in each of the 1st and 3rd years of his or her term, save only when either a justice has retired or died during that period (and the sitting president has made a nomination) or when the turnover has been so great that no justice has served less than 15 years. The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years. This would mean that the composition of the court would never lag politics by more than 5-10 years. It would also mean that the justices would be more cautious about taking radically new directions (like destroying the voting rights act and campaign finance regulation) in view of any majority they assemble to rewrite the law inevitably dissolving in much less than a generation. This arrangement would preserve judicial independence while knocking individual justices off the thrones they currently occupy.",supreme court,0,1.0

Nuclear energy only provides 8% of U.S. energy. We could easily conserve 8% and then begin the decommissioning of every nuclear power plant.

Germany is HUGELY successful with Wind and Solar Energy. Germany has produced the energy-equivalent of 20 nuclear power plants (yes 20!!) with Solar Energy alone!

I guess we have to come down to 'survival of the fittest' or we will burden down the healthy in our society until they are drowned and doomed by the unhealthy. Healthcare premiums need to relate to unhealthy actions of individuals. Smoking, excess drinking, drug use and over eating etc., need to have penalties but right now we have set up the a system that requires the responsible healthy to pay their bills for them so WHO CARES!.

That such a statement should even be made tells us that something has gone seriously wrong with our democracy.' Correct -- there is something wrong. Among the wrongs is that many of the Constitution's provisions are general ones, thereby allowing multiple interpretations (e.g. ""living Constitution"", ""originalism"", ""texturalism""; conservative, liberal). This leads to Supreme Court Justices commonly being picked politically on the basis of the category (or their perceived politics) to which they presumably belong. Justices are not ""umpires"", to use Robert's word, in the sense of baseball where rules are clear and broadly followed. Rather, they are ""umpires"" each of whom follows their own set of rules and who are picked to do so. It's worth considering that doing similarly in baseball would destroy the game.",supreme court,1,1.0

"So the plan is simply to hand an 85-year old senior citizen a cash payment and put the onus on them to decide if a procedure or test their doctor tells them they need is a good idea or not; when they're short on food and rent, and are trying to save money.

That's their voting base. And the entire reason for the election and re-election of President Obama. First of all, a society that claims to be free CANNOT force people to vote. It irrevocably ceases to be free as soon as you require people to do things they don't have any interest in doing. Second, forced participation for the sake of participation is an idea that could only originate with and be supported by a group of politicians who know that preying on the poor, ignorant, and easily manipulated is their best chance to hold onto power forever. Simply force them to vote and then lie constantly to demonize the opposition, and you ALWAYS win!

"The author's opinion of public transit in Los Angeles and San Francisco / Oakland / San JosÃ© is dated. Both metro areas have good public transit, and getting better. Even if LA's is not currently much used by upper middle class riders, these are not the only people we care about. Moreover, he is badly mistaken when he says that a high-speed rail service ""doesn't touch the huge mass of traffic, which swirls daily in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas."" Intercity rail and local transit are mutually supportive. Predictably, if high speed trains arrive in downtown LA, more people will use the red, gold and other rail lines to reach their trains than currently do to get to LAX.

"I believe too much emphasis is being place on voter turnout, and not enough emphasis is being placed on education. Is a low unemployment rate a good thing? Yes. Is a high rate of education a good thing? Yes. Is a high voter turnout a good thing? Well, quite frankly that depends. Why is it high? Is it high because concerned, informed citizens are making their voices heard? Not if you move the needle by making it mandatory. You see, voter turnout isn't the answer, it's an indicator. It simply tells you what question you need to ask next. Because what we want is not a high voter turnout. What we want is a large majority of Americans making their opinions heard. While voter turnout is an indicator of that, you don't cure a disease by covering up the symptoms. If educated people tend to vote more, then that should be the focus. If we succeed in better educating the American people, voter turnout should naturally go up, providing a good indicator of how well we are doing.",voting,1,1.0

I take walks on that campus and I rarely think about guns being near me because they will be near me pretty much any where I go in Utah. When I go to the 24 hour fitness gym at Trolley Corners about 2 miles away I sometimes do remember the mass shooting that occurred at Trolley Square just across the street about 9 years ago. The gym is in a basement which would be a hard to escape shooting gallery if somebody wanted to shoot up the place. But even there it usually doesn't cross my mind most of the time. Maybe I'm getting a little bit too used to the concealed and open carry idea.",gun,0,0.0

"Herein lies the rub ...""Many require remedial courses to catch up to college-level work."" What are we doing wrong in K-12 to prepare students for the rigors of college? Heck, my daughter has well above a 4.0 and has scored high on PSAT, etc and I still worry about the rigors of college. We need to set up all students for success. If we have to teach them in college what they should have learned in high school then they are not ready for college whether it's paid for or not. I'm all for heavily subsidizing the cost of a college education for students who can't afford it because I'm a believer in the ""all boats rise"" theory and I think equal access to higher education is crucial to changing a person's trajectory in life. It's also not the only way. Yes, there are plenty of students attending college on their parents' dime who don't make it and while that wouldn't fly with me, it's their money, not mine.

Addiction is a selfish disease and it takes the selfish mind to want to beat it for themselves. You can't coerce a person against their will to see the light. Forcing a person into withdrawals and hope they see the good in it afterwards is a gamble. Not all addicts are the same, so I believe in individual based treatment that focuses on the reason for the addiction, psychologically.

American higher education is the best in the world - but that would quickly change if guns were allowed on campuses. The idea that more guns are the solution to gun violence simply defies reason - and if you believe that, Ms. Collins, you apparently learned nothing in college. There are non-lethal alternatives for self-defense: mace, pepper spray, etc. If you could have drawn a pistol quickly enough to defend yourself (questionable, if you were taken by surprise), you certainly could have fired a can of pepper spray just as quickly.

My enthusiasm turned to repugnance when I realized that succeeding in the humanities was more about politics and high theory than a passion and a dedication to teach literature. Now I am back to working in information technology. Universities were once the gateways to information and learning. With the internet and our vast open information resources, we no longer have to pay outrageous tuition costs in order to get access to those resources and commentary on those resources. The best thing that my two years off gave me was the time to read the great works of Western culture.

"As long as school boards hire and promote administrators based on political cronyism, patronage, nepotism, religious and ethnic affiliation, gender, race, sexual orientation and any other specious criteria and considerations, teachers will always need the basic protections provided by tenure. Good administrators who know how to objectively evaluate teachers learn to work within the tenure system to deal with ineffective teachers. Lazy administrators who rely on complaints from parents made through their connections to school board members employ tactics designed to intimidate, demean, frighten and coerce unwanted teachers to voluntarily resigning. Those tactics rarely work. As a result performance and morale further deteriorate, and the entire school community suffers.",turk,2,2.0

The studies to which you refer examine calorie restriction diets, which do not work because they induce a starvation-like state that leads to metabolic changes. Changing the *types* of foods we eat is far more productive. There's evidence that eliminating wheat alone will reduce the number of calories people eat by an average of 300 a day.

For my generation NATO was mainly about defending Western Europe against the feared encroachment of the then Soviet Union. Following the second world war Germany was weak and divided. NATO's real mission ended with the reunification of Germany and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since those events NATO has been an organization in search of a purpose. It keeps getting dragged in to questionable areas like Afghanistan and middle eastern civil wars such as happened in Libya. The USA should move to withdraw its military and its money from Europe at the earliest opportunity. Where else to station troops? probably on our border with Mexico.

This attitude of course misses innumerable advantages of learning a foreign language, and shokcinlgy enough, even a dead language like Latin.

"Mr. Adams, in the absence of regulations, there would be no financial fallout. As an example, auto emissions impose large costs on society i.e., pollution, and on many individuals in society, for example those with respiratory problems. But car manufacturers do not bear those costs - the costs are externalities to the manufacturer. Markets are in general very good at coordinating supply and demand and allocating capital but markets only work if economic actors both receive the benefits but also bear the costs of their business decisions. Regulations, however imperfect, are necessary because, in many circumstances economic actors receive the profits but do not pay the costs of their activity. In such circumstances it is rational for a firm maximize its profits while ignoring the costs, however large, of its business activities. If there were no emissions regulations, including penalties for violating, those regulations, VW would face no financial fallout.

Campuses forcing greek life to go co-ed will lead only to the national chapters of these organizations to suspend their charters at the school.

As an addiction medicine physician I think it would be worthwhile to force treatment on addicts if their use is a danger to self and others. I have worked all over the country and one state that allows this already is South Carolina. I can sign papers as a doctor and mandate treatment. Treatment for substance abuse is effective if it's voluntary and also if its involuntary. Sometimes patients left to make their own decision will not make the right one and will not do on their own so it's a way of getting the thousands of people who really need treatment to treatment. In most cases it's not a moral hazard for a hospital . Hospitals may file papers for force substance abuse treatment but quite often the individual would go to another facility elsewhere. Because there is an drug epidemic and that opiate overdose is the leading cause of death over motor vehicle accidents in young people in this country something must be done .

"I share these concerns but I believe that the problem lies in a misalignment of the 9 justices with the body politic, and that this is the result of 30- and 40-year tenures of modern justices. The solution is term limits for justices. Every president should nominate 1 justice in each of the 1st and 3rd years of his or her term, save only when either a justice has retired or died during that period (and the sitting president has made a nomination) or when the turnover has been so great that no justice has served less than 15 years. The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years. This would mean that the composition of the court would never lag politics by more than 5-10 years. It would also mean that the justices would be more cautious about taking radically new directions (like destroying the voting rights act and campaign finance regulation) in view of any majority they assemble to rewrite the law inevitably dissolving in much less than a generation.

Nuclear energy only provides 8% of U.S. energy. We could easily conserve 8% and then begin the decommissioning of every nuclear power plant. Then we could take the BILLIONS and BILLIONS of dollars thrown at the nuclear industry and invest it in Renewable Energies like Wind and Solar Energy. Germany is HUGELY successful with Wind and Solar Energy. Germany has produced the energy-equivalent of 20 nuclear power plants (yes 20!!) with Solar Energy alone! They are having the same success with Wind Energy. This success in Renewable Energy proves how obsolete and unnecessary nuclear energy is.,rock roll,2,2.0

If the goal is to reign in healthcare costs, it seems to be a far better idea to use the negotiating power of the government (and ACOs, Accountable Care Organizations) to hold healthcare providers accountable for ineffective and unnecessary testing and procedures. What I find most objectionable about the more conservative plans on this forum is that even though they frame their solutions as being mainly about reducing government waste, it really seems to always be about protecting the big monied interests or the super wealthy from ever taking a hit.

"I would be in favor of the following. At least one of the two chambers (presumably the Senate) should ONLY have voters who have graduated from college. Right now, we talk about everyone voting, as if it was some kind of religious ritual like the Sabbath or Ramadhan. But voting is not a religious ritual, it is participation in government making. And those who do not read newspapers and do not understand the issues, should preferably not vote. I know my point of view is unusual, in a society where voting is regarded as a kind of party - the more the better. But perhaps this is an area where skill matters. If most voters had graduated from college, I doubt that we would see Cain or Perry as viable candidates. We complain that they are appealing to ignorant voters, and at the same time we insist that more of the ignorant vote. This is foolish.

"Wrong, America does not have serious voter turnout problems. Democrats have serious voter turnout problems. Of course they would support mandating that people ignorant of the issues vote.

It irrevocably ceases to be free as soon as you require people to do things they don't have any interest in doing. Second, forced participation for the sake of participation is an idea that could only originate with and be supported by a group of politicians who know that preying on the poor, ignorant, and easily manipulated is their best chance to hold onto power forever. Simply force them to vote and then lie constantly to demonize the opposition, and you ALWAYS win!

Tuition is too high for many reasons, chiefly because colleges and universities for the most part compete to be all things to all people, so faculty and classroom space must constantly expand. Also, only the wealthy pay the 'rack rate' full tuition at the top institutions with decent endowments or state funding. Free tuition would increase two things: more marginally or unqualified applicants and proliferation of easy, feel good, study yourself courses and majors. The idea of substituting community service for standardized test scores and grades as a basis for admission will further dilute the seriousness of university scholarship.

In addition, when detainees complain about the conduct of an officer, he can check the recording of the arrest. Most of these complaints are without merit. So, it sounds to me that there is a benefit to the police and society by using the cameras. As far as privacy considerations, the cameras are being used in a public space, so I do not see this as a problem. (I am a member of the ACLU.)",college,2,2.0

"I live about 2 blocks from the University of Utah campus, where concealed carry has been permitted for something like 5 years now, but only for people who meet the usual criteria for such which means only those 21 or over can legally carry. Utah is also a state which is getting used to open carry. I've seen examples of that practice maybe every third month or so. That is also permitted on campus here, but only for concealed carry permit holders. I take walks on that campus and I rarely think about guns being near me because they will be near me pretty much any where I go in Utah. When I go to the 24 hour fitness gym at Trolley Corners about 2 miles away I sometimes do remember the mass shooting that occurred at Trolley Square just across the street about 9 years ago. The gym is in a basement which would be a hard to escape shooting gallery if somebody wanted to shoot up the place. But even there it usually doesn't cross my mind most of the time. Maybe I'm getting a little bit too used to the concealed and open carry idea.",supreme court,2,2.0
"I can't understand why the justification for the study of Humanities is utilitarian in most of the pieces and blogs in this article. Certainly critical thinking skills can be obtained in the social and natural sciences (often to a greater degree than in languages) and ditto for the other general skills it supposedly provides (but not necessarily). The point is that Humanities constitutes windows to many areas of human thinking and accomplishment in the past and present--and that in itself is sufficient justification. The arguments put forth by Humanists in this piece are not very compelling (if that is a sign of the skills the discipline trains them for). Include some scientists in the debate to make it interdisciplinary. An important issue that has determined the desperate thinking of parents and students is that the cost of university education--even public education--has gone up enormously and the investment cost in education (for families and the state) makes them increasingly think in these narrowly pragmatic terms. It is a reality, not merely a sign of increasingly philistine times.",religious belief,2,2.0

"Dr. DuPont and the three other debaters conveniently overlook an important part of the current epidemic of prescription opioid abuse: we really know very little about it. As a physician who specializes in pain management I can tell you that we don't know how many people who are abusing and becoming addicted to these drugs obtained them illicitly, how many lied to physicians to obtain them, and how many received them for legitimate pain complaints. If we coerce this last group into getting treatment for the substance abuse, who's going to do something about their pain? Also benzodiazepine abuse and addiction is a major problem and we know that these are mostly a result of physicians prescribing these without giving much thought to the abuse potential. Do any of the debaters recommend forcing these patients into treatment for this problem?

"I think that with the vast amount of resources available on the internet, it's vital that we continue to assign research papers. But, with the assigning of research papers, teachers and professors must ensure that they are teaching the proper critical reading and analytical skills with which to evaluate and utilise these resources. Given the extremely complex world in which we live, the ability to reason critically and vigorously couldn't be stressed enough. Assigning essays and the research paper would enable students to work with seeming volumes of sometimes contrasting information, come to a view, defend that view, and reconcile that view with differing ones - that's what we do everyday, and the ability to do it well is necessary to maintain a free-thinking, socially- and environmentally-responsible, democratic society.",gun,2,2.0

If we have to teach them in college what they should have learned in high school then they are not ready for college whether it's paid for or not. I'm all for heavily subsidizing the cost of a college education for students who can't afford it because I'm a believer in the ""all boats rise"" theory and I think equal access to higher education is crucial to changing a person's trajectory in life. It's also not the only way. Yes, there are plenty of students attending college on their parents' dime who don't make it and while that wouldn't fly with me, it's their money, not mine.
